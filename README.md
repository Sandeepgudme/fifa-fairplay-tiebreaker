## ⚽ FIFA Fair Play Tiebreaker Simulator

When all four teams in a World Cup group finish with the **same points**, **same goal difference**, and even **same goals scored**, FIFA uses **Fair Play Points** to break the tie.

This web app allows you to simulate that scenario — just enter yellow cards, indirect reds (2 yellows), and direct red cards for each team, and the app will calculate rankings based on FIFA’s fair play scoring system.
